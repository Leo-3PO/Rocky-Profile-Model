= Rocky-Profile-Model (RPM)

This repository contains a C++ Implementation of Hiro Matsumoto's Rocky Profile Model for coupling with cosmogenic radionuclide accumulation components of RoBoCoP. 

The RPM object is the exploratory morphodynamic model developed by https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2016.05.017[Matsumoto et al. (2016a)] and http://www.bioone.org/doi/10.2112/SI75-120.1[Matsumoto et al. (2016b)].

This version was developed for coupling to predictions of cosmogenic isotope concentrations using the https://github.com/mdhurst1/RoBoCoP_CRN/[RoBoCoP_CRN] model developed by http://www.pnas.org/content/113/47/13336.abstract[Hurst et al. (2016)] and http://www.earth-surf-dynam.net/5/67/2017/[Hurst et al. (2017)].
