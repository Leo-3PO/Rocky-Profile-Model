= Hiro-Model

C++ Implementation of Hiro Matsumoto's Shore Platform Numerical Model

The Hiro object is the exploratory morphodynamic model developed by http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X16303385[Matsumoto et al. (2016a)] and http://www.bioone.org/doi/10.2112/SI75-120.1[Matsumoto et al. (2016b)].

This version was developed for coupling to predictions of cosmogenic isotope concentrations using the https://github.com/mdhurst1/RoBoCoP\_CRN/[RoBoCoP\_CRN] model developed by http://www.pnas.org/content/113/47/13336.abstract[Hurst et al. (2016)] and http://www.earth-surf-dynam.net/5/67/2017/[Hurst et al. (2017)].
